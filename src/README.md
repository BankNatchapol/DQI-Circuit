I'll review the paper from arXiv and the blog post on quantum computing stack exchange to determine the optimal polynomial degree for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI). I'll then provide a code snippet that converts parameters into the appropriate polynomial degree.

I'll update you once I have the necessary information.

# Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) and Polynomial Degree

**Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)** is a quantum optimization algorithm that biases the sampling towards high objective values by applying a polynomial transformation to the objective function $f$ before interference (via the quantum Fourier transform) ([[2408.08292] Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08292#:~:text=optimization%20has%20been%20a%20major,Muller%20codes%2C%20respectively)). In DQI, one chooses a polynomial $P(f)$ that transforms the distribution of objective values, effectively “shaping” the quantum state’s amplitudes so that higher-$f$ solutions are more likely to be measured ([New Quantum Algorithm Dance: DQI Edition – The Quantum Pontiff](https://dabacon.org/pontiff/2024/10/29/new-quantum-algorithm-dance-dqi-edition/#:~:text=The%20general%20problem%20space%20that,find%20the%20maximum%20given%20this)) ([New Quantum Algorithm Dance: DQI Edition – The Quantum Pontiff](https://dabacon.org/pontiff/2024/10/29/new-quantum-algorithm-dance-dqi-edition/#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20%E2%80%9Cderive%E2%80%9D%20DQI)). A key design question is: **what polynomial $P(f)$ (and in particular, what degree** $\ell$ **) is optimal** for maximizing the expected value of $f$? 

## Optimal Polynomial in DQI

**Initial guess vs. actual optimum:** It might seem natural to choose a polynomial like $P(f) = f^\ell$ (a monomial of degree $\ell$) to favor high-$f$ outcomes ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=It%20is%20natural%20to%20guess,ell)). Indeed, raising $f$ to a high power amplifies the difference between large and small values. However, *this turns out not to be optimal*. The authors found that better results are obtained by using a polynomial that **includes lower-degree terms up to $\ell$**, rather than only the highest-degree term ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=It%20is%20natural%20to%20guess,ell)). In other words, the optimal $P(f)$ has nonzero coefficients for many monomials from degree $0$ through $\ell$ (not just $f^\ell$ alone).

**Why include lower-degree terms?** The expected objective value under DQI can be written as an overlap sum: 

$$ \langle f \rangle \;=\; \sum_{f=-m}^{m} w(f)\,P(f)^2, $$ 

where $m$ is the number of constraints (so $f \in [-m, m]$), $w(f)$ is the number of assignments achieving objective value $f$, and $P(f)$ (suitably normalized) determines the quantum state’s outcome probabilities ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=%24%24%20,m%7D%5Em%20w%28f%29%20P%28f%29%5E2)). The distribution $w(f)$ depends on the specific error-correcting **code** $C$ used in the DQI mapping. (DQI reduces the optimization instance to a decoding problem on a code $C$ ([[2408.08292] Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08292#:~:text=Interferometry%20,XORSAT%20are%20reduced%20to)).) A useful approximation is to treat each of the $m$ constraints as independent, so that $w(f)$ follows a binomial-like distribution centered around $f=0$ ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=The%20quantity%20%24w,perp)). In fact, one can show that the first $d^\perp$ moments of $w(f)$ (where $d^\perp$ is the **dual code’s distance**) match those of a true binomial distribution ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=2%5E%7Bn,perp)). This means that if we only use polynomial terms up to a certain degree, the quantum algorithm’s behavior is indistinguishable from random guessing up to that moment order. To **exploit differences in the tails** of the distribution (i.e. favor the high-$f$ tail where optimal solutions lie), the polynomial must leverage higher moments. In practice, this translates to using a polynomial with support on all degrees **up to a certain optimal $\ell$** rather than concentrating all weight at exactly $\ell$.

**Finding the optimal coefficients:** Solving for the optimal polynomial $P(f)$ (i.e. finding the best coefficients for each power of $f$ up to $\ell$) can be done via **Fourier analysis** or an equivalent eigenvalue problem. The DQI authors note that directly optimizing $\langle f \rangle$ by treating the $w(f)$ sum was algebraically messy, but reformulating it as a Fourier analysis (or **spectral** problem) made it tractable ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=It%20is%20this%20property%20of,is%20done%20in%20our%20manuscript)). In essence, one constructs a certain **tridiagonal matrix** (arising from the recurrence relations of orthogonal polynomials for the distribution $w(f)$) and finds its principal eigenvector. This eigenvector gives the optimal weight distribution $\{w_0, w_1, \dots, w_\ell\}$ for the polynomial’s coefficients ([Decoded Quantum Interferometry Algorithm - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/dqi/dqi_max_xorsat/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20paper%20,expected%20ratio%20of%20satisfied%20constraints)) ([Decoded Quantum Interferometry Algorithm - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/dqi/dqi_max_xorsat/#:~:text=diag%20%3D%20np,1)). For example, in a simple case one might find an optimal solution like $P(f) \propto 0.707f + 0.707f^2$ instead of just $f^2$, indicating that **both** the linear and quadratic terms contribute optimally (with equal weight in that case) rather than using only the quadratic term.

## Choosing the Optimal Polynomial Degree (ℓ)

So, how do we determine the **proper polynomial degree $\ell$** for DQI? In practice, $\ell$ should be set based on the structure of the underlying decoding problem – specifically, how many “errors” the classical code can reliably correct. Key points to consider:

- **Include all degrees up to $\ell$:** The optimal $P(f)$ uses a polynomial of degree $\ell$ but **with nonzero coefficients for all powers $\le \ell$** ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=It%20is%20natural%20to%20guess,ell)). Simply using $f^\ell$ alone is suboptimal; lower-degree monomials must be included to maximally boost $\langle f \rangle$. 

- **$\ell$ tied to code’s error-correcting ability:** The maximum degree $\ell$ essentially sets the *maximum number of constraints that can be unsatisfied (errors)* that the decoder will handle ([Decoded Quantum Interferometry Algorithm - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/dqi/dqi_max_xorsat/#:~:text=match%20at%20L877%20,that%20the%20decoder%20should%20decode)). In coding terms, if the associated classical code $C$ can correct up to $\ell$ errors, then using polynomial terms up to $f^\ell$ makes sense – beyond that, the quantum algorithm would be pushing into regimes the classical decoder can’t resolve. Thus, **$\ell$ should be chosen to match the code’s capability**. For instance, in the paper’s *Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI)* example, the optimization reduces to decoding a Reed–Solomon code, which can be efficiently decoded up to about half its minimum distance. In that case one would choose $\ell \approx \lfloor d^\perp/2 \rfloor$ (half the dual code distance) ([complexity theory - What codes can Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) exploit best? - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41149/what-codes-can-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi-exploit-best#:~:text=decodability%20up%20to%20%24,there%20more%20such%20nice%20codes)). Generally, using $\ell$ equal to the code’s unique-decoding radius (half the minimum distance for linear codes) is a good guideline for the optimal polynomial degree.

- **Instance-independent setting:** Thanks to the moment-matching property of $w(f)$, the optimal $\ell$ can often be determined **without needing to tailor to a specific instance** ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=2%5E%7Bn,perp)). If the code’s parameters are known (e.g. block length, distance), one can set $\ell$ from those. If not, a reasonable heuristic is to increase $\ell$ until the improvement in expected value tapers off – which typically coincides with the point at which the classical decoder would start to fail (for random constraints, this is often around the point where unsatisfied constraints become too many to correct).

In summary, the **optimal polynomial degree** $\ell$ is the highest degree needed in $P(f)$, and **all degrees from 0 to $\ell$ should be used** with appropriate coefficients. The value of $\ell$ is chosen based on the decoding problem’s hardness: it should not exceed the number of errors the classical decoding subroutine can handle. This ensures DQI leverages quantum interference up to the point where classical decoding can still distinguish and correct the corresponding patterns of constraint satisfaction.

## Python Code Snippet for Optimal Degree

Below is a simple Python function that determines the recommended polynomial degree $\ell$ for DQI given the problem parameters. It uses the code’s dual distance (if known) to pick $\ell$, or falls back to a conservative fraction of the total constraints if the code parameters are unknown:

```python
def optimal_polynomial_degree(num_constraints, dual_distance=None):
    """
    Determine the optimal polynomial degree (ell) for DQI.
    - num_constraints (m): number of constraints in the optimization problem.
    - dual_distance (d_perp): dual code distance of the associated code (optional).
    Returns: optimal polynomial degree ell.
    """
    if dual_distance is not None:
        # Use half the dual distance (floor) as max errors to decode
        return dual_distance // 2  
    else:
        # If code distance unknown, default to half the constraints as a heuristic
        return num_constraints // 2

# Example usage:
m = 100  # e.g., 100 constraints
d_perp = 50  # e.g., dual code distance is 50
print("Optimal degree:", optimal_polynomial_degree(m, d_perp))
# If dual distance is known (50), this will output 25 (half of 50).
```

**How this works:** If we know the code’s **dual distance** $d^\perp$, we set $\ell = \lfloor d^\perp/2\rfloor$, reflecting the code’s ability to correct up to that many errors ([complexity theory - What codes can Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) exploit best? - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41149/what-codes-can-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi-exploit-best#:~:text=decodability%20up%20to%20%24,there%20more%20such%20nice%20codes)). If we lack that information, we use a simpler heuristic (here, half the number of constraints) as a proxy for a typical decodable error count. In a real scenario, one could refine this by incorporating more knowledge of the problem’s structure or by iteratively testing increasing degrees until the expected value gain saturates. The chosen $\ell$ should then be used to construct the polynomial $P(f)$ with nonzero coefficients from $f^0$ through $f^\ell$, using (for example) the eigenvector method described in the paper to find the exact optimal coefficients ([optimization - Choosing an optimal polynomial for Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) - Quantum Computing Stack Exchange](https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/41150/choosing-an-optimal-polynomial-for-decoded-quantum-interferometry-dqi#:~:text=It%20is%20this%20property%20of,is%20done%20in%20our%20manuscript)).
